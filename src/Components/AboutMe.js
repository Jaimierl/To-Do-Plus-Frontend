                  I am a Software Engineer with a Business Analytics background. After experiencing the problem-solving capabilities of Python coding through my work at Zillow I decided on a career change. That brought me here to Code Fellows. During my time at Code Fellows, I plan to learn the methods and capabilities of Python. After graduating I hope to begin a career in Software Engineering working in a fast-paced environment where I am constantly being challenged and learning from my peers.

                  <p className="text-center">
                    Anthony is an aspiring Software Developer with a background in odd jobs. He believes the ultimate goal of technology should be to reduce humanityâ€™s collective burden. Just like how the refrigerator solved food spoilage and the washing machine freed up hours of scrubbing, he wants to build programs that free people from their chains of labor.
